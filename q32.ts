//Question no 32: Checking Usernames: Do the following to create a program that simulates how websites ensure that everyone has a unique username.
//• Make a list of five or more usernames called current_users.

let current_users = ["Latif", "Ali", "Manan", "Shakeel", "Jawad"]

//• Make another list of five usernames called new_users. Make sure one or two of the new usernames are also in the current_users list.

let new_users = ["Afaq", "Latif", "ali", "Ahmed", "Bilal"]

//• Loop through the new_users list to see if each new username has already been used. //case insensitive
//If it has, print a message that the person will need to enter a new username. If a username has not been used, 
//print a message saying that the username is available.
