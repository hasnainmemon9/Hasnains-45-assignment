//Question no 40 :- Album :Write a function called make_album() that builds a Object describing a music album.
//The function should take in an artist name and an album title, and it should return a Object containing these two pieces of information.
//Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different albums.
//Print each return value to show that Objects are storing the album information correctly. 
// Add an optional parameter to make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album.
//If the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value to the albumâ€™s Object.
//Make at least one new function call that includes the number of tracks on an album.

function make_album(artist_name: any, album_title: any, tracks?: any){
    let album: {artist: any, album: any, tracks?: any} = {
        artist: artist_name,
        album: album_title,
    };
    if (tracks !== undefined){
        album.tracks = tracks;
    }
    return album;
}

let album1 = make_album("Noor", "Album title 1", 1);
let album2 = make_album("Laiba", "Album title 2", 10);
let album3 = make_album("Nasheed", "Album title 3", 5);

console.log(album1);
console.log(album2);
console.log(album3);
