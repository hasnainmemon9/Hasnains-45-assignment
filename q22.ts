//Question 22: Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array
// index error in one of your programs yet, try to make one happen.
// Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error.
// Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

//Creating an array:
let errorArray: string[] = ["Watermelon" , "Mango" , "Orange"];

//Producing error ! by accessing invalid value of array:
//console.log(erroeArray[6]);
//it is undefined.

//Removing error:
console.log(errorArray[2]);
